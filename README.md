#### Summary: 
Oddly enough having completed this to do list, I can absolutely say there was not one utilized while coding this... Which was an absolute Rookie move! I hope you enjoy what my current version of this 
to do list is, and look forward to seeing you on the next project!

#### Demonstrates: 
  - HTML input forms 
  - Live feed for list updating
  - Java onClick functions 
  - Variables for checkbox text strike-through; and deletion
